# VibeCheck---Grace
VibeCheck Grace & MJ is a simple Node.js + Express API project with a frontend button UI for CPE 411L. The backend provides endpoints to get a random fortune (/api/fortune), a joke (/api/joke), mood-based messages (/api/vibe?mood=happy|tired|stressed), a smash counter (POST /api/smash and GET /api/smashes), and a secret message (/api/secret?code=411L). The frontend (index.html and app.js) contains buttons that fetch data from these endpoints and display it on screen, including a SMASH button that increments a counter. To run, install dependencies in backend/ using npm install and start the server with node index.js (default http://localhost:3000), then open frontend/index.html in a browser. The GitHub workflow uses three feature branches (feature/api-routes, feature/smash-counter, feature/frontend-ui), each with at least two commits, followed by pull requests into main with collaborator reviews. The smash counter is stored in memory and resets when the server restarts, and the secret endpoint requires code 411L to unlock the message.
